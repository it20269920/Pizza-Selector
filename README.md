# Pizza-Selector
This program that calculates the cost of a pizza based on its size and the number of pieces, and determines the lowest cost for the customer:
This code defines a function pizza_cost() that takes two arguments: the size of the pizza and the cost per square inch. The function calculates the area of the pizza using the formula for the area of a circle and then multiplies that by the cost per square inch to get the total cost of the pizza.
Then the code tests this function with different pizza sizes and prices and prints out the cost of each size. After that, it compares the costs of different size pizzas and prints out the lowest cost pizza for the customer.
